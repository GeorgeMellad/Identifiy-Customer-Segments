# Identifiy-Customer-Segments
The last project of Udacity Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow.

In this project, you will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.
